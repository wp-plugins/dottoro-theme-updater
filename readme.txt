Dottoro Updater plugin is an automation tool to update your Dottoro themes migrating their actual skin settings to the updated ones.

== Description ==
The Dottoro Theme Updater plugin notifies you about the available theme updates, but maybe even more important, it ensures updating the skins along with the themes.

You will find the available theme updates among the default WordPress Theme updates, where you can update your themes in the standard way.

The plugin works in single and multisite WordPress installations as well.

The settings for the Dottoro Updater plugin can be set on the plugin settings page (under 'Appearance' > 'Dottoro Updater' in single, and 'Plugins' > 'Dottoro Updater' in multisite WP).
